Fake news is false or misleading information presented as fact. It's packaged to look like real journalism but is intentionally deceptive â€” often spread for political influence, financial gain, or ideological agendas.

# ðŸ“š Origins of the Term

The phrase "fake news" gained widespread attention during the 2016 US election, but misinformation campaigns go back much further. In the digital era, it's often spread via social media or partisan websites.

## ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º Australian Examples

In Australia, fake news has circulated around COVID-19, climate change, referendums, and election misinformation. Itâ€™s a growing concern for media regulators and public trust.

### ðŸŽ¯ What Makes It Dangerous?

- It erodes trust in public institutions
- Itâ€™s often designed to polarise or manipulate
- It can travel faster than fact-based corrections

#### ðŸ§­ How to Respond

Media literacy, strong journalism, and responsible tech platforms are key to tackling fake news. Regulation also plays a growing role â€” such as proposed misinformation legislation in Australia.

**Related terms:** misinformation, disinformation, media bias, clickbait, media literacy
